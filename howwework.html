                <h1>How we work</h1>
				<p>
					We have completed over 100 development assignments, and have never failed to deliver a well working technical solution.
					
					System perspective:
					We offer solutions that are an integral part of the overall system to best fit your needs. 
					Through our extensive experience we have developed a genuine understanding and interest to see the overall system.
					Our offer is based around the motor control in the center and fully integrated solutions for adjacent functionality such as 
					HMI, Battery management, Sensors, Communication and Signal processing can all be part of our scope of delivery.
					These additional functions can often be integrated into the same hardware and software as the motor control, 
					thereby creating a price-, performance- and space-efficient solution. 
					These additions can also include external products such as motor, enclosure and display to make a complete subsystem for easy integration into your application.
